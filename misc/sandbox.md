tell — don’t ask — parents for what you need.  Instead of saying, “Do you want to sing Wheels on the Bus with me?” say, “Next, you and I will sing Wheels on the Bus and see if Jacob will vocalize in response to music.”

Like children, adults learn by doing.  If you think that watching behind a window is enough to teach you what you need to know about implementing a therapy program at home, ask yourself this:  Would you watch a basketball game on TV and think it would be enough to make you a star player?

auditory closure/wait time/ acoustic highlighting


Laundry
Putting things in/taking them out
Comparative -er/ Superlative -est (this sock is smaller, this shirt is bigger)
Colors, textures, materials
Clothing vocabulary (the child may have shirt, but does he have blouse, t-shirt, polo shirt, etc.?)
Possessive -‘s (Mom’s shirt, Dad’s socks, etc.)
Plurals (socks, pants, etc.)
 

Dishes
Clean/dirty
Wet/dry
/s/ blends: stack, splash, spoon, spill, sponge, etc.
Prepositions: put that away under the sink, but that on top of the counter, etc.
 

Cleaning up toys
Identification by attribute (clean up all of the wooden toys, all of the plastic toys, etc.)
Auditory-only multi-step directions (put away the cars before you put away the puzzles)
Identification by materials: cloth toys, wooden toys, plastic toys, etc.


 Strategies like parallel talk (talking about what you’re doing) and narration (talking about what the child is doing) can make even the most mundane activity an opportunity to expose your child to new vocabulary and language structures.
 
 Acoustic highlighting is a key strategy in Auditory Verbal Therapy.

 Whisper to devoice noisy vowels that get in the way of hearing voiceless consonants.  If a child is missing the final /t/ in “but,” repeating the word with increased volume and emphasis will just “amplify” the /b^/ part of the word, making the /t/ even harder to hear. In this case, the wrong highlighter gets you farther away from your goal, causing both you and the child lots of frustration.
  
 
 Pause before a missed word to draw attention that something is there.  We adults speak way, way too fast (I am certainly guilty!).  Small children who are curious about exploring the world sometimes seem like they never sit still.  Combine the two, and you have the perfect recipe for missing words.  Take a breath, add a pause — you’ll catch their attention and help the child pick up on a new word in a way that another acoustic highlighting technique may not.
  
 
 Emphasize a vocabulary word at the end of a sentence.  Put the key word at the end of a known phrase (e.g. if you are working on food vocabulary, have a restaurant where each person can use the carrier phrase “I’d like a…” and then fill in the blank with the new word).
  
 
 Repeat a new phrase to make it stick.  “That gingerbread man is boasting!  Can you believe it?  He is boasting!  He boasted about being faster than the baker.  He boasted about being faster than the woman.  He even boasted about being faster than the dog!”
  
 
 Sing to capture the child’s attention.  Singing, or even just adding a tiny bit of intonation and melody to your voice (naturally!  don’t fall into the dreaded “Teacher Voice,” an inappropriate sing-song-y pattern).  If we’re working on asking questions with “where + NOUN?” I might sing, “Oh no!  Where’s Mommy?”

 Respond to your baby when he babbles.
 
 When your child says something, comment back by repeating what your child says but with an additional word or two to make the utterance richer, more detailed, or more grammatically correct.
 
  Turn off televisions, radios, computers, and other sources of electronic noise.
  
  
  
  Playing Tricks in Therapy
  Posted on April 1, 2015 by earosenzweig
  Serious, boring therapy?  No thank you!  Practical jokes can be a lot of fun, but look beneath the surface and you’ll find a wealth of listening and language goals, too.  Let’s talk about sabotage, theory of mind, jokes, and helping children with hearing loss develop a sense of humor.
  
   
  
  SABOTAGE
  One way to keep therapy from becoming dry, boring, and predictable is to learn to use the technique called “sabotage.”  It’s not as deceitful as it sounds.  Sabotage is simply doing something out of the ordinary to gain the child’s attention, spark conversations, and create a “communication temptation” that leads to speech, listening, and language growth.
   
  
  Sabotage works because it quickly captures the child’s interest by providing a break from the expected (hey!  something weird is going on here!) and it creates a situation that requires the child to communicate.  It can be used for children at any level, from babies (where the communication we’re looking for might just be vocalization to call/recognize, e.g. “aah!” + pointing to say, “Mama, look at that!”) to children with advanced language skills (where I might expect them to fully explain to me what is wrong with this situation).  It’s easy to do, it’s tons of fun, and it can spark some great language interactions!
   
  
  What are some common ways to use sabotage in a therapy session?
  Plan an art project.  Bring out a box of old markers that are dried out, or bottles of glue that have sealed shut, or only enough paper for half of the people in the room.
  Hand a child who is old enough to read a wordless book and ask him to read it to you.
  Put toys inside containers that the child cannot open independently.
  Give the child a toy to play with that is broken, or a game with missing pieces.
  Have a snack.  Try to pour juice into a cup from a closed bottle.  Give everyone a plate except the child.  Give the child a knife (instead of a spoon) for eating yogurt.
  Play dress up.  Put on clothes that are too big or too small.  Put clothing on the wrong place (e.g. a hat on your foot, a sock on your arm).
  Bake something.  Set out the ingredients for the recipe but leave a few out.  Put a whole egg into the bowl without cracking it.
  Put a stuffed animal on your head, or a sticker on your nose.  Pretend not to notice until the child points it out to you.
  Throw a pretend birthday party.  Blow out candles that are not lit.  give the child a “present” with multiple layers of wrapping paper, or a wrapped box with nothing in it.  Try to blow up a balloon that has a hole.
   
  
  You can also use sabotage to work on listening and self-advocacy skills.  Put a dead battery in the child’s hearing aid or cochlear implant, and see if she will point it out to you.  For children with cochlear implants, use the remote to secretly turn their processor’s volume down.  Will they notice the change?  Speak to the child in a voice that’s too soft, or too mumbly, or turn the background music up too loud.  All of these communication sabotages require the child to speak up about his or her listening needs.
   
  
  They key to sabotage is to play dumb.  Once the child notices that something is out of the ordinary, expect her to use language (at whatever level) to fix the problem.  Don’t be a mind reader.  You put a sock on your hand and the child pointed?  Great!  But don’t move that sock.  Wait it out.  Whether you’re looking for “No!” or “Foot!” or “Right there!” all the way up to “Socks go on your feet, not on your hands.  That’s that wrong place!” you’ll never get that language unless you give the child time to process and expect language before continuing the game.
   
  
   THEORY OF MIND
  Theory of mind is the ability to predict and understand the thoughts and feelings of others, to comprehend that what is in my mind is different and separate from what other people experience.  For example: Jane and Tom are in a room and Jane puts the cookie in the cookie jar.  Tom leaves the room, and Jane moves the cookie to the cupboard.  When Tom comes back in, where will he look for the cookie?  A child with developed Theory of Mind skills will know that Tom last saw the cookie in the cookie jar, so that’s where he will look.  A child who does not have the ability to separate what he knows from what Tom knows will say that Tom will look in the cupboard (“I know it’s there, so why wouldn’t he?”).
   
  
  Children with hearing loss have been shown to be at great risk for delayed or deficient theory of mind skills when compared to hearing peers (see Peterson, 2004, among others).  We hypothesize that this is due to early lack of access to communication and incidental learning (that “overhearing potential” — listening to adults talk through their thought processes can help teach theory of mind).  Playing tricks in therapy is one great way to work on this skill.  Help the child set up a practical joke to play on the parent (or on you, the therapist).  Talk through the why it will work (Mom stepped out of the room, and we hid all of the toys under the table.  When she comes back, she won’t know where they are because she didn’t see us do it), and what you have to do to pull of a good surprise (don’t give it away!).
   
  
  What are some other ways to develop this important skill?  You can also work on theory of mind while reading books.  Talk about characters’ emotions, motivations, and what they might be thinking or feeling in certain pictures.  The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson is one of my favorite books for ToM.  Act out various pretend play scenarios (going to the doctor, flying on an airplane, etc.) and use this as an opportunity to think out loud to make each “character’s” inner mental dialogue more accessible to the child (“I am the doctor, and I see my patient has a red face and is sweaty.  Maybe she has a fever”).
   
  
   
  
  SENSE OF HUMOR
  Language is about more than correct grammar and articulation.  We also have to consider pragmatics, or the social aspect of language — using appropriate tone, how to enter a conversation, how to speak appropriately in different contexts (e.g. formal presentations vs. joking with family), etc.  This is another area in which children with hearing loss have traditionally experienced some difficulty.  Developing a sense of humor requires a combination of many skills:  You have to have appropriate tone (teasing can be playful or mean depending on how you say it), intelligence and theory of mind to understand why a joke is funny, and the language and grammar to communicate it effectively.
   
  
  Developing a sense of humor ties in to developing good self-esteem and self-concept regarding hearing loss, too.  If you can laugh about yourself and take mistakes and miscommunications in stride, you can diffuse many awkward situations.  If a child with hearing loss can project comfort with himself, he’ll make others comfortable with his hearing loss, too.
   
  
  Here are some fun ways to work on humor in therapy:
  Tell jokes.  There are many simple kids’ joke books, jokes on Laffy Taffy wrappers, etc.  Knock Knock jokes follow a particular script or routine, which is great for young children.  Many jokes rely on puns or multiple meanings of words — a great opportunity to work on some metalinguistic (“thinking about language”) skills and phonological awareness.
  Talk about tone.  Take a simple sentence (“I like your blue hat”) and talk about all of the different ways you could say it.  Can you say this sentence like you are angry?  Like you are jealous?  Like you are being sarcastic?  Like you are happy?  Like you a teasing? etc.  Helping children with hearing loss understand and use appropriate tone can head of misunderstandings, either when the child says something that’s taken poorly because of how he says it, or when the child misunderstands another person’s intent in communication.
  Read funny books and sing funny songs.

 В наш детский сад был направлен неорганизованный ребёнок  (1год 5 мес) по заключению ПМПК с диагнозом «Двухсторонняя сенсоневральная глухота, состояние после кохлеарной имплантации», то мне пришлось изучить много  специальной литературы такой как: Королёва И. В. «Развитие слуха и речи у глухих детей раннего возраста после кохлеарной имплантации», «Дети с нарушением слуха», «Кохлеарная имплантация и дети», О. В. Зонтова « Рекомендации для родителей по развитию слухового восприятия детей с нарушенным слухом» и некоторые источники в интернете. С  первых занятиях  начала использовать игры, которые помогают различать и опознавать неречевые звуки, и привлекала внимание к звучащим предметам. Для этого использовала такие игры «Кто в гости пришел?», «Где звенит?», «Тихо- громко», «Звенит не звенит», «Тук-тук», так же  включала в свою работу игры презентации цель которых — узнавать звуки окружающей среды с разной громкостью. Перед предъявлением звука или слова привлекала слуховое, и зрительное внимание ребенка указывала на своё ухо и говорила  «Слушай». Например, при проведении игры «Тук-тук» повторяла слова и стучала по столу, мама помогала привлечь внимание к моим действиям, повторяла «тук-тук» и показывала на ухо: «Ты слышишь?» я слышу «тук-тук». Принципиально важным является повторение одних и тех же слов, действий, жестов, что помогает запоминать слова и действия. Малыши любят открывать и закрывать разные коробочки, вынимать и убирать в них мелкие предметы. На этом основана игра «Шумящие коробочки», во время игры малыш слышит повторяющиеся звуки. Главное в таких играх вызвать интерес к звукам, развивать навык прислушиваться к звучанию разных предметов. В каждое занятие включаю упражнения на развитие дыхания и мелкую моторику, это так же способствует развитию речи.

 In the evenings, read bedtime stories.
 These are useful in more ways than
 one. They help to develop your child’s
 language. They provide valuable information.
 They arouse a child’s natural
 curiosity. You can even take photos of
 vacations, family, pets, and things you
 have done, and put them in a book to
 talk about later on.
 When you’ve finished reading, remember
 to leave on a nightlight. Children
 with normal hearing can still hear the
 television and the clink of a spoon in a
 coffee cup even when the lights are
 out, but children with hearing loss
 appreciate the feeling of security a
 nightlight can provide.
 
 Always talk to your child, even though
 he or she may not always fully understand
 what you’re saying. The only way
 to encourage him or her to develop
 spoken language and the right kind of
 behavior is by speaking clearly yourself,
 and by setting a good example.
 And remember that your facial expressions
 and body language also tell an
 interesting story!
 
 Getting involved in practical tasks,
 such as doing the laundry. Name
 different items of clothing, explain
 loading the washer and talk about
 the sounds it makes. Talk about
 what you are doing as you go along.
 
  Involve your child in the kitchen
 activities. If you are baking cookies
 or cupcakes, talk about the different
 ingredients, and explain where they
 come from. Find or draw pictures to
 help your child make the connection
 between eggs and chickens, flour
 and corn, etc.
 
  Picture games are also very useful
 when teaching your child about
 objects, concepts, and language.
 
  If you go for a walk or a drive, point
 out different things you see and
 describe them as you go by.
 
  Before going shopping, go through
 some of the items you’re going to
 buy on the shopping list. Again,
 make drawings if necessary. And let
 your child try to find some of the
 different products on the shelves
