# Communicative Temptations

When trying to help your child to actively participate in communication, there has to be:
* a need
* an opportunity
* and a reward for efforts.

Communicative Temptations are a way to make sure that these three things happen.
One of the most important things that we can do to assist in a child’s development of communication, is to not anticipate his or her needs/wants. By not anticipating, you give your child an opportunity to show what s/he needs/wants.
* Eat a desired food item in front of your child without offering any to him or her.
* Activate a windup toy,let it deactivate and hand it to your child.
* Give your child four blocks to drop in a box one at a time (or use some other action that your child will repeat, such a stacking the blocks or dropping the blocks on the floor), then immediately give your child a small animal figure to drop in the box.
* Look through a few books with your child.
* Initiate a familiar and an unfamiliar social game with your child until s/he expresses pleasure, then stop the game and wait.
* Open a jar of bubbles, blow bubbles,then close the jar tightly. Hand the closed jar to your child.
* Blow up a balloon and slowly deflate it. Hand the deflated balloon to your child or hold the deflated balloon to your mouth and wait.
* Hold a food item or toy that your child dislikes out near your child to offer it.
* Place a desired food item or toy in a clear container that your child cannot open while your child is watching. Put the container in front of your child and wait.
* Place your child’s hands in a cold; wet or sticky substance, such as jello, pudding or paste.
* Roll a ball to your child. After your child returns the ball three times, immediately roll a rattle or a toy on wheels to him or her.
* Engage your child in putting together a puzzle. After your child has put in 3 pieces, offer your child a piece that does not fit.
* Engage your child in an activity with a something that can be easily spilled (or dropped, broken, torn, etc.). Suddenly spill some of the substance on the table or floor in front of your child and wait.
* Wave and say “bye bye” to a toy upon removing it from the play area. Repeat this for a second and third toy, and do nothing when removing a fourth toy. These four trials should be interspersed throughout the other temptations, rather than be presented in a series.
* Hide a stuffed animal under the table. Knock, then bring out the animal. Have the animal greet your child the first time. Repeat this for a second and third time, and do nothing when bringing out the animal for the fourth time. These four trials should also be interspersed when presented.
* Put an object that makes noise in an opaque bag and shake the bag. Hold up the bag and wait.
* Give your child the materials for an activity of interest that needs an instrument for completion (e.g., piece of paper to draw on or cut; bowl of pudding or soup). Hold the instrument out of your child’s reach and wait.
* Engage your child in an activity of interest that needs an instrument for completion (e.g., crayon for drawing, spoon for eating, or wand for blowing bubbles). Have a third person come over and take the instrument, go sit on the distant side of the room, while holding the instrument within your child’s sight and wait.

Ways To Get Your Child To Speak

ways of “tempting” your child to speak

Create an opportunity for the student to request materials, reinforcers, and/or help.

1. Eat something your child loves in their presence with out offering them any. When your child indicates that they would like some, model a more advanced way for them to make the request, whether it is using a sign, a word or a simple phrase. For example, if your child points and grunts to the candy, model the sign for candy then wait and see if your child will imitate the sign candy. If your child simply keeps pointing and grunting take his/her hand and help him make the sign for candy then reward him/her with the candy.

2. Play with something your child loves but don’t offer to share.
For instance if your child loves playing with playdough and wants to participate in the fun, you could model the /p/ sound for “please” or “play,” or you could model the signs for please or play. If your child can already say one word model a two word phrase for him/her to imitate like, “play please.”

3. At meal time and snack time give your child bite size portions, rather than dishing up a whole serving for them, then wait for them to request more. If no attempt is made model the sign “more,” help them make the sign, or model the /m/ sound for them to imitate.

4. Limit your child’s access to things like the t.v., toys, food, or going outside. Set it up so they have to make a request or ask for help to access these things. You may accomplish this by putting favorite things up high or locked up.

5. Play turn-taking games such as rolling the ball back and forth, or pushing a car back and forth. Once your child expects another turn hold the car or ball and wait. Look at him/her expectantly if no sign or verbal request is made, model an appropriate request such as the sign for “ball,” the /b/ sound, the word “ball” or “ball please”…

6. Use tight containers to store things in. When your child indicates he/she wants a cookie you might hand him/her the cookie jar (tightly sealed of course), when he/she can’t open it and hands it back to you make him/her sign open or help.

7. Use wind up toys or other toys that are difficult for kids to operate on their own. Wind up a wind-up toy your child gets a kick out of then hand it to them when they want a turn, wait for them to request help by using the sign or the word to operate the toy.

8. Blow bubbles then screw the lid on tightly and hand it back to your child for their turn. Wait for them to request help with a a sign or a word. Model the sign or word if necessary.

SETTING THE STAGE FOR COMMUNICATION
Communication should happen all day and everyday. Pictures need to be readily available right across the day,
not just at snack times or during a structured lesson.
The following ideas will help you set the stage for communication that can happen across the day:
Put things out of reach, on high shelves, in containers, so that students have a need to communicate.
Keep favourite items away for a few days, especially at the start of PECS, so that they are really
motivating.
Stop anticipating and meeting students‟ needs and responding to other attempts at communicating, such
as pulling you by the hand, crying, tantrums, etc.
Make your students want to communicate (see Communication Temptations on page 54 of your manual)

1. Enter into their world by using motivating people, items, etc. to encourage communication
For many children, food is motivating. For others, it could be specific toy, movie, friend, family member or neighbor.

For example, if your child loves interaction with a specific family member, use this motivating person to encourage communication. If you are using this person to encourage communication, use a variety of visual and auditory strategies (e.g. use a picture of the family member and/or model the name of this individual). Encourage your child to point to the picture of this person or exchange the picture with you to request it. When they are able to point or exchange the picture, the motivating person could come over to the child and give him or her a hug to fulfill the request.

To learn more information about using a picture exchange communication system, check out PECS USA.

2. Label feelings as they occur
For example, if your child is reaching for food in the fridge, label the feeling. For example, say “You are hungry”. The more your child hears the particular feeling with a specific behavior, the better they will be able to understand that feeling.

This strategy needs to be consistent and occur naturally. Modeling a feeling can happen when your child is excited, sad, hurt, happy, etc. For example, as your child expresses their excitement, say “I see you are excited”. If you have a picture of “excited” it can even reinforce the concept more. Learn more about using visuals here.

3. Assume competence
Assuming competence is probably one of the most important things we can do as a parent, caregiver, therapist, teacher, etc. Assuming competence for any child whether they have a disability or not is a form of empowerment.
Assuming that your child CAN do it and WILL do it is powerful. The other concept is speaking to a child with Autism like any other child. Children with or without disabilities pick up very quickly when an adult or another child is speaking to them in a different way. This can be a strategy that can very helpful when telling others how to speak to your child.

4. Model Language and use Aided Language Stimulation
Modeling language is an excellent strategy. Many times a child may not know the specific word or structure of a sentence. For example, if your child wants water at the dinner table and indicates that to you in a way that you will understand, say “I want water.” Giving the model will help improve your child’s receptive and expressive language.

Communicative Temptations
Communicative temptations create a reason for a child to communicate. They allow
opportunities for initiation. Good ways to provide communicative temptations are to
interrupt an established routine, “forget” to do something, or make desired items
inaccessible. Some suggested activities are listed below.
1. Give the child part of their food or drink and wait or eat a desired food in front of
them without offering any to them.
2. Interrupt an established routine and wait for their response.
3. Initiate a familiar game with the child until they express pleasure, then stop.
4. Open a jar of bubbles, blow bubbles, then close the jar tightly and hand it to the
child.
5. Blow up a balloon and slowly deflate it. Hold the deflated balloon up to your
mouth and wait or hand it to the child and wait.
6. Get the child interested in an activity that requires an instrument to complete,
ex. A crayon for colouring, a spoon for eating, a wand for blowing bubbles. Have
a third person come and take the item away and go to sit on the other side of
the room within the child’s sight. Wait.
7. Offer the child a food or toy that they dislike.
8. Activate a windup toy, let it run down, then hand it to the child.
