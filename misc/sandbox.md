Like children, adults learn by doing.  If you think that watching behind a window is enough to teach you what you need to know about implementing a therapy program at home, ask yourself this:  Would you watch a basketball game on TV and think it would be enough to make you a star player?

 Strategies like parallel talk (talking about what you’re doing) and narration (talking about what the child is doing) can make even the most mundane activity an opportunity to expose your child to new vocabulary and language structures.
 
 Acoustic highlighting is a key strategy in Auditory Verbal Therapy.

 https://auditoryverbaltherapy.net/2015/10/16/acoustic-highlighting/
 
 Whisper to devoice noisy vowels that get in the way of hearing voiceless consonants.  If a child is missing the final /t/ in “but,” repeating the word with increased volume and emphasis will just “amplify” the /b^/ part of the word, making the /t/ even harder to hear. In this case, the wrong highlighter gets you farther away from your goal, causing both you and the child lots of frustration.
  
 
 Pause before a missed word to draw attention that something is there.  We adults speak way, way too fast (I am certainly guilty!).  Small children who are curious about exploring the world sometimes seem like they never sit still.  Combine the two, and you have the perfect recipe for missing words.  Take a breath, add a pause — you’ll catch their attention and help the child pick up on a new word in a way that another acoustic highlighting technique may not.
  
 
 Emphasize a vocabulary word at the end of a sentence.  Put the key word at the end of a known phrase (e.g. if you are working on food vocabulary, have a restaurant where each person can use the carrier phrase “I’d like a…” and then fill in the blank with the new word).
  
 
 Repeat a new phrase to make it stick.  “That gingerbread man is boasting!  Can you believe it?  He is boasting!  He boasted about being faster than the baker.  He boasted about being faster than the woman.  He even boasted about being faster than the dog!”
  
 
 Sing to capture the child’s attention.  Singing, or even just adding a tiny bit of intonation and melody to your voice (naturally!  don’t fall into the dreaded “Teacher Voice,” an inappropriate sing-song-y pattern).  If we’re working on asking questions with “where + NOUN?” I might sing, “Oh no!  Where’s Mommy?”

  Playing Tricks in Therapy
  Posted on April 1, 2015 by earosenzweig
  Serious, boring therapy?  No thank you!  Practical jokes can be a lot of fun, but look beneath the surface and you’ll find a wealth of listening and language goals, too.  Let’s talk about sabotage, theory of mind, jokes, and helping children with hearing loss develop a sense of humor.
  
   
  
  SABOTAGE
  One way to keep therapy from becoming dry, boring, and predictable is to learn to use the technique called “sabotage.”  It’s not as deceitful as it sounds.  Sabotage is simply doing something out of the ordinary to gain the child’s attention, spark conversations, and create a “communication temptation” that leads to speech, listening, and language growth.
   
  
  Sabotage works because it quickly captures the child’s interest by providing a break from the expected (hey!  something weird is going on here!) and it creates a situation that requires the child to communicate.  It can be used for children at any level, from babies (where the communication we’re looking for might just be vocalization to call/recognize, e.g. “aah!” + pointing to say, “Mama, look at that!”) to children with advanced language skills (where I might expect them to fully explain to me what is wrong with this situation).  It’s easy to do, it’s tons of fun, and it can spark some great language interactions!
   
  
  What are some common ways to use sabotage in a therapy session?
  Plan an art project.  Bring out a box of old markers that are dried out, or bottles of glue that have sealed shut, or only enough paper for half of the people in the room.
  Hand a child who is old enough to read a wordless book and ask him to read it to you.
  Put toys inside containers that the child cannot open independently.
  Give the child a toy to play with that is broken, or a game with missing pieces.
  Have a snack.  Try to pour juice into a cup from a closed bottle.  Give everyone a plate except the child.  Give the child a knife (instead of a spoon) for eating yogurt.
  Play dress up.  Put on clothes that are too big or too small.  Put clothing on the wrong place (e.g. a hat on your foot, a sock on your arm).
  Bake something.  Set out the ingredients for the recipe but leave a few out.  Put a whole egg into the bowl without cracking it.
  Put a stuffed animal on your head, or a sticker on your nose.  Pretend not to notice until the child points it out to you.
  Throw a pretend birthday party.  Blow out candles that are not lit.  give the child a “present” with multiple layers of wrapping paper, or a wrapped box with nothing in it.  Try to blow up a balloon that has a hole.
   
  
  You can also use sabotage to work on listening and self-advocacy skills.  Put a dead battery in the child’s hearing aid or cochlear implant, and see if she will point it out to you.  For children with cochlear implants, use the remote to secretly turn their processor’s volume down.  Will they notice the change?  Speak to the child in a voice that’s too soft, or too mumbly, or turn the background music up too loud.  All of these communication sabotages require the child to speak up about his or her listening needs.
   
  
  They key to sabotage is to play dumb.  Once the child notices that something is out of the ordinary, expect her to use language (at whatever level) to fix the problem.  Don’t be a mind reader.  You put a sock on your hand and the child pointed?  Great!  But don’t move that sock.  Wait it out.  Whether you’re looking for “No!” or “Foot!” or “Right there!” all the way up to “Socks go on your feet, not on your hands.  That’s that wrong place!” you’ll never get that language unless you give the child time to process and expect language before continuing the game.
   
  
   THEORY OF MIND
  Theory of mind is the ability to predict and understand the thoughts and feelings of others, to comprehend that what is in my mind is different and separate from what other people experience.  For example: Jane and Tom are in a room and Jane puts the cookie in the cookie jar.  Tom leaves the room, and Jane moves the cookie to the cupboard.  When Tom comes back in, where will he look for the cookie?  A child with developed Theory of Mind skills will know that Tom last saw the cookie in the cookie jar, so that’s where he will look.  A child who does not have the ability to separate what he knows from what Tom knows will say that Tom will look in the cupboard (“I know it’s there, so why wouldn’t he?”).
   
  
  Children with hearing loss have been shown to be at great risk for delayed or deficient theory of mind skills when compared to hearing peers (see Peterson, 2004, among others).  We hypothesize that this is due to early lack of access to communication and incidental learning (that “overhearing potential” — listening to adults talk through their thought processes can help teach theory of mind).  Playing tricks in therapy is one great way to work on this skill.  Help the child set up a practical joke to play on the parent (or on you, the therapist).  Talk through the why it will work (Mom stepped out of the room, and we hid all of the toys under the table.  When she comes back, she won’t know where they are because she didn’t see us do it), and what you have to do to pull of a good surprise (don’t give it away!).
   
  
  What are some other ways to develop this important skill?  You can also work on theory of mind while reading books.  Talk about characters’ emotions, motivations, and what they might be thinking or feeling in certain pictures.  The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson is one of my favorite books for ToM.  Act out various pretend play scenarios (going to the doctor, flying on an airplane, etc.) and use this as an opportunity to think out loud to make each “character’s” inner mental dialogue more accessible to the child (“I am the doctor, and I see my patient has a red face and is sweaty.  Maybe she has a fever”).
   
  
   
  
  SENSE OF HUMOR
  Language is about more than correct grammar and articulation.  We also have to consider pragmatics, or the social aspect of language — using appropriate tone, how to enter a conversation, how to speak appropriately in different contexts (e.g. formal presentations vs. joking with family), etc.  This is another area in which children with hearing loss have traditionally experienced some difficulty.  Developing a sense of humor requires a combination of many skills:  You have to have appropriate tone (teasing can be playful or mean depending on how you say it), intelligence and theory of mind to understand why a joke is funny, and the language and grammar to communicate it effectively.
   
  
  Developing a sense of humor ties in to developing good self-esteem and self-concept regarding hearing loss, too.  If you can laugh about yourself and take mistakes and miscommunications in stride, you can diffuse many awkward situations.  If a child with hearing loss can project comfort with himself, he’ll make others comfortable with his hearing loss, too.
   
  
  Here are some fun ways to work on humor in therapy:
  Tell jokes.  There are many simple kids’ joke books, jokes on Laffy Taffy wrappers, etc.  Knock Knock jokes follow a particular script or routine, which is great for young children.  Many jokes rely on puns or multiple meanings of words — a great opportunity to work on some metalinguistic (“thinking about language”) skills and phonological awareness.
  Talk about tone.  Take a simple sentence (“I like your blue hat”) and talk about all of the different ways you could say it.  Can you say this sentence like you are angry?  Like you are jealous?  Like you are being sarcastic?  Like you are happy?  Like you a teasing? etc.  Helping children with hearing loss understand and use appropriate tone can head of misunderstandings, either when the child says something that’s taken poorly because of how he says it, or when the child misunderstands another person’s intent in communication.
  Read funny books and sing funny songs.

 В наш детский сад был направлен неорганизованный ребёнок  (1год 5 мес) по заключению ПМПК с диагнозом «Двухсторонняя сенсоневральная глухота, состояние после кохлеарной имплантации», то мне пришлось изучить много  специальной литературы такой как: Королёва И. В. «Развитие слуха и речи у глухих детей раннего возраста после кохлеарной имплантации», «Дети с нарушением слуха», «Кохлеарная имплантация и дети», О. В. Зонтова « Рекомендации для родителей по развитию слухового восприятия детей с нарушенным слухом» и некоторые источники в интернете. С  первых занятиях  начала использовать игры, которые помогают различать и опознавать неречевые звуки, и привлекала внимание к звучащим предметам. Для этого использовала такие игры «Кто в гости пришел?», «Где звенит?», «Тихо- громко», «Звенит не звенит», «Тук-тук», так же  включала в свою работу игры презентации цель которых — узнавать звуки окружающей среды с разной громкостью. Перед предъявлением звука или слова привлекала слуховое, и зрительное внимание ребенка указывала на своё ухо и говорила  «Слушай». Например, при проведении игры «Тук-тук» повторяла слова и стучала по столу, мама помогала привлечь внимание к моим действиям, повторяла «тук-тук» и показывала на ухо: «Ты слышишь?» я слышу «тук-тук». Принципиально важным является повторение одних и тех же слов, действий, жестов, что помогает запоминать слова и действия. Малыши любят открывать и закрывать разные коробочки, вынимать и убирать в них мелкие предметы. На этом основана игра «Шумящие коробочки», во время игры малыш слышит повторяющиеся звуки. Главное в таких играх вызвать интерес к звукам, развивать навык прислушиваться к звучанию разных предметов. В каждое занятие включаю упражнения на развитие дыхания и мелкую моторику, это так же способствует развитию речи.

 In the evenings, read bedtime stories.
 These are useful in more ways than
 one. They help to develop your child’s
 language. They provide valuable information.
 They arouse a child’s natural
 curiosity. You can even take photos of
 vacations, family, pets, and things you
 have done, and put them in a book to
 talk about later on.
 When you’ve finished reading, remember
 to leave on a nightlight. Children
 with normal hearing can still hear the
 television and the clink of a spoon in a
 coffee cup even when the lights are
 out, but children with hearing loss
 appreciate the feeling of security a
 nightlight can provide.
 
 Always talk to your child, even though
 he or she may not always fully understand
 what you’re saying. The only way
 to encourage him or her to develop
 spoken language and the right kind of
 behavior is by speaking clearly yourself,
 and by setting a good example.
 And remember that your facial expressions
 and body language also tell an
 interesting story!
 
 Getting involved in practical tasks,
 such as doing the laundry. Name
 different items of clothing, explain
 loading the washer and talk about
 the sounds it makes. Talk about
 what you are doing as you go along.
 
  Involve your child in the kitchen
 activities. If you are baking cookies
 or cupcakes, talk about the different
 ingredients, and explain where they
 come from. Find or draw pictures to
 help your child make the connection
 between eggs and chickens, flour
 and corn, etc.
 
  Picture games are also very useful
 when teaching your child about
 objects, concepts, and language.
 
  If you go for a walk or a drive, point
 out different things you see and
 describe them as you go by.
 
  Before going shopping, go through
 some of the items you’re going to
 buy on the shopping list. Again,
 make drawings if necessary. And let
 your child try to find some of the
 different products on the shelves

 It is vitally important that parents are involved in the habilitation of their child immediately following a cochlear implant. Much of this habilitation can be achieved through listening activities. These activities can be done during structured play sessions, or throughout the day while you are doing everyday tasks, such as shopping trips, bath-time etc. It is important to be aware of the language level of your child, and this will depend on the age of the child, their level of understanding, and their auditory abilities prior to the implant. It is vitally important to start training at the right level and not make tasks too difficult, so the child can be motivated by a high success rate during activities.
 
 
 Auditory training
 
 There is a hierarchy of treatment with auditory training, and if you are starting at the beginning with a child that has only recently been aided or implanted, the initial auditory work will just be getting the child to discriminate between sound and no sound. Firstly, a child just needs to hear and react to sounds. Can they tell the difference between no sound and a sound? Do they react with a pause or a look when they hear a new sound? One way to start sound awareness is to encourage the child to wait, with their back to you, then you make a sound with a toy or object (such as shaking a marble in a cup), and see if they react. When the child hears the sound and reacts, praise him. Doing this in a structured activity relies on teaching the child a conditioned response. This means they will respond by looking, touching, holding your hand or even putting a bean in a cup, each time they hear a sound. Initially, although the child may acknowledge sounds, they may not necessarily recognise them. When the child can react to the difference between sound and no sound we work through a number of steps:
 
 Discrimination between long and short sounds
 Discrimination between 2 different sounds. If working on speech sounds, discriminating vowel sounds can be difficult so we must use sounds that are not only different, but also have different formant frequencies
 Differentiating between one and two syllable words/nonsense words
 Discriminating between words containing different vowels (e.g pot and pet)
 Discriminating between words with different initial or final sounds (e.g. day/pay or hearse/herd
 Discriminating words in Closed Set word lists and Open Set word lists. Closed set word lists may be a smaller set of words that are familiar to the listener and initially quite different in sound. Open set word lists introduce new words and might be more complicated because some words may be in the same category or have similar sounds.
 An example of a Closed Set word list - shoe, pyjamas, gloves (this group of words has different initial sounds, different vowel sounds, and pyjamas has more syllables). A much harder closed set would be - hat, mat, mouse, house, rat (this group is more difficult as some initial and vowel sounds are the same, there is rhyme, and there are also words with close semantic links e.g. Mouse/rat). An Open Set word list can have an endless list of choices and exposes the child to new words, these tasks are much  more difficult.
 
 The initial stages of sound development
 
 A newly implanted child is likely to have very little sound knowledge. It is the role of parents and/or caregivers to label these sounds for the child, bring the child’s attention to the sound and have a joint focus. Outside the therapy environment the parent or caregiver should be alerting the child to all sorts of sounds, pointing to the source of sounds, naming the source of sounds, and having a joint focus.
  
 
 Listen, can you hear the bird?	Yes, it's a car
 
 Once the child starts to become aware of their own name and some sounds around them in the environment, it might be time to look at doing some more structured tasks involving pattern perception. Pattern perception refers to a child’s ability to differentiate between long and short sounds, or continuous and interrupted sounds, and later, small words and big words. To start with, we want to perform closed set activities, meaning that the child knows and is aware of all the sounds or words we want them to listen to. For instance, look at a familiar group of toys and name them all so the child is familiar with them. Then choose two toys which vary in name, sound, and syllable length, and without using sign or letting the child lipread, (sit behind or at the side of the child), name one item and see if the child can point to it by listening, discriminating and understanding. Once the child becomes used to the game and adept at discriminating sounds you can do this activity throughout the day, for instance, discriminating between products in a shop, or objects when out for a walk. As the child improves, increase the number of items in the choice from two to three, and so on.
 
 As the child’s skills develop, you can progress to using simple sentences in closed tasks e.g. This can begin with some same/different tasks e.g. 2 sets of the same words, but one set has a different word at the end - “are these 2 sets the same, or different?”
 
 pot pot pot pot       pot pot pot pet
 tap tap tap tap       tap tap tap tap
 Asking the child to discriminate words in phrases and words with background noise will also facilitate their listening development. Finally, to promote their word knowledge, we offer choices with questions (e.g. “Which one do you write with”), so their auditory comprehension is developed further. Once the child feels confident at this level, we need to start considering open set tasks. Open set tasks begin to introduce new sounds or words that the child is not familiar with. The child will need to discriminate, learn and attempt to articulate them as their skills develop.
 
 Auditory Verbal Therapy
 
 One of the most successful approaches for facilitating speech and listening for children with cochlear implants, is Auditory Verbal Therapy. This approach focuses on listening and sound awareness, as this is the most natural and efficient way that children learn speech. With auditory verbal therapy every possible opportunity to listen and learn is used through the day, using the child's environment as a learning tool.
 
 Auditory Verbal Therapy (AVT) involves the family and Speech and LanguageTherapist/Pathologist (SLT) who facilitate the child to learn to talk through listening (as a naturally hearing child would learn). Listening, speech, and language are all developed through active listening activities which become a part of play, education and communication on a daily basis. Parents are encouraged to be the primary facilitators of their child’s listening and speech development.
 
 The process is helped by early diagnosis of hearing impairment and the fitting of hearing aids or a cochlear implant for optimal amplification. Parents also have to be committed to participate and work closely with the relevant professionals. The child learns through listening rather than watching. AVT should be administered by a qualified Auditory-verbal therapist who will guide and work with the parents so that they re-produce therapy activities at home in a natural way. Many of the activities we have discussed earlier will be part of the AVT program.
 
 CI coilOne of the techniques used in AVT is called an “auditory sandwich” where the therapist sits on the aided side of the child repeating auditory information several times, then presenting a visual clarifier (object, picture etc), and then presenting the auditory information again, making sure to use language that is rich in suprasegmental qualities (e.g. Pitch, prosody etc).
 
 Acoustic highlighting is also used to stimulate the listening environment. This involves using variables such a background noise, distance, complexity and rate of utterance to vary the acoustic conditions and really train the child to listen.
 
 There are a number of levels of development of speech and listening skills following the implant:
 
 Awareness of sound - responding to sounds
 Sound has meaning - associating a specific sound with an object in the environment  
 Early Listening - responding to music, vocalising, imitating mothers vocal play, some approximations of short words - e.g. “Mama”
 Discrimination - discriminating between environmental sounds (inside and outside), quiet and loud sounds and different peoples' voices. Beginning to recognise own name, discriminating some short common phrases, imitating some short phrases
 Localisation Skills - beginning to be able to localise sounds from increasing distances
 Distance and directional listening - having awareness of sounds in all directions. Discriminating familiar words and familiar commands from all directions at increasing distances
 Listening in background noise - recognising familiar words, phrases and commands with increasing differences, in all directions with background noise
 Auditory memory and sequencing - ability to make choices from several options, starting to have ability to select pictures in sequence. Imitating several word sequences
 Development of short term memory - ability to pick several named objects from a larger group. Longer term memory will also expand, remembering names and more vocabulary
 Using more words and phrases, and knowing some simple songs. Ability to recount information such as addresses and describe past events
 This development will not happen overnight and the success of therapy will be dependant on total commitment from the parents, caregivers and educational healthcare team around the child.
 
 Speech
 
 At the same time as teaching listening, we also want to promote speech. Trying to get children to repeat or name items on request is not the best way to teach speech, we need to find a way for the child to speak on their own terms, where they are in control and in a relaxed environment with no pressure. We need to provide good models for speech, not only naming things for the child, but also repeating back a correct version of their attempts at speech, and praising them every time they attempt speech.
  
 
 Playing with dolls	Yes, it's a car
 
 Once the child is actively listening, discriminating and using some speech we can start to look at some speech therapy ideas that focus on speech as well as listening. Usually it helps if the child is a little older when you want to start speech work, because the younger child is often either unaware of what the therapist is trying to achieve, and/or it is difficult to describe certain concepts such as back and front sounds etc. However, listening activities should still be the priority.
 
 It will take time for the child to develop their new listening skills and speech. We have to remember that for some children it will be as if they have the hearing of a newborn and every sound they hear will be new. A cochlear implant can be very effective at promoting listening and speech skills and many children’s speech will eventually become as good as their peers.

* All skills are taught with an emphasis on listening – audition first!
* One of the main premises of the Auditory-Verbal approach is that parents are their children’s primary language role model in the preschool years.



<details>
 <summary>Інші методики..</summary>
 
### Методика Леонгард

* Основой Системы Э.И.Леонгард является отношение к неслышащим как к равным со слышащими в возможностях психического, языкового, культурного, социального, физического развития, но нуждающихся в специальной и длительной помощи 
* Слухопротезирование бинауральное
* занятия по развитию речевого восприятия и дифференциации слухового различения
* В систему абилитации должны быть включены родители
* Жестовый язык не должен использоваться в обучении и развитии глухих и слабослышащих детей до овладения ими устной и письменной речью
* При нашем подходе развитие речевого слуха происходит в единстве с развитием у детей понимания речи и в устной, и в письменной формах. Это отличает нас от других подходов, при использовании которых развитие слухового восприятия и развитие речи фактически являются двумя обособленными процессами, отчего у детей страдает  понятийная сторона речи, и дети испытывают большие трудности при чтении текстов по всем школьным дисциплинам
* Разговаривать нужно совершенно естественно, и каждый член семьи должен сохранять свою манеру речи. В ходе обучения постоянно организуются  специальные ситуации общения (описанные в методических рекомендациях), кроме этого, ребёнок живёт в речевой среде, поэтому он приучается  понимать естественную речь слышащих людей
* Занятия должны естественным образом вплетаться в жизнь. Упраженение должно быть игровой или бытовой ситуацией. Надо сделать так, чтобы ребенку было интересно с родителями не только, когда с ним играют, но и когда родители заняты деятельностью, обычной в повседневной жизни. К этим занятиям привлекается необходимый словарь, родители должны называть предметы и действия, которые совершают. Если ребенок учится читать, то именно в таких случаях появляются первые таблички.

Скільки слів повинна говорити дитина в 2 роки?

У дитини від 1 року до 3 років розвиток мови йде стрімко. Основне завдання – познайомитися не тільки з предметами, але і з їх призначенням: що це, навіщо воно? Щоб розібратися у всьому різноманітті навколишнього середовища, дитині потрібно багато спілкування. Малюк може не просто наполягати, а відверто вимагати: поясни! Покажи! Що з цим робити?!

Це необхідний етап розвитку, і пропускати його не можна: відповідайте на всі питання, розповідайте історії (не дивлячись на те, що дитина здатна фокусувати увагу дуже недовго), вчіть його говорити з іграшками, з картинками, з домашніми тваринами.




До півтора років дитина розуміє значення багатьох слів: зокрема, знає частини тіла, виконує прості інструкції (піди принеси чашку) і здатний встежити за нескладною розповіддю за сюжетними картинками.

Нормальний словниковий запас дитини в 1,5 року – 20 слів, до 2 років цей показник подвоюється і може досягати 50 слів. У період від півтора до двох років формується звичка висловлювати думки за допомогою простих речень. Стартовий варіант може містити лепетні слова, які потім будуть замінюватися повноцінними (наприклад, «Ваня Піпі» – «Ваня попісяв»).

## Глобальне читання

Читання глобальне ( читання цілого слова  чи виразу без поділу його на звуки ) є безпосередньою стимуляцією правої півкулі головного мозку.  Є важливим терапевтичним чинником та добрим стартом для подальшої праці з дитиною не лише для логопеди, але й батьків і самої дитини. Наука глобального читання застосовується лише на початку терапії. Глобально вводиться лише відносно невелику кількість іменників з найближчого оточення дитини ( лялька, авто, мама, тато, банан і тд.) та імена , які оточують дитину на кожен день ( ім"я мами - наприкл. Аня, ім"я тата - наприкл. Коля і власне ім"я дитини - наприкл. Ліля, якщо є барити-сестри , то і їхні імена теж). Можна наочно продемонструвати відповідні імена до їх носіїв. Для цього варто використати світлини найближчої родини , вклеїти на білий аркуш паперу та підписати великими друкованими літерами однакової величини.  В такий самий спосіб вводиться основні дієслова, які характеризують щоденні дії дитини ( їсть, п"є, малює, йде, сидить і тд. ) Для цього нам будуть потрібні відповідні зображення й проведення тої самої маніпуляції, що й з фото членів сім"ї , з відповідними підписами дієслів під ними.
Вступом до глобального розпізнавання слів і виразів є дана поетапність дій в науці читання синхронно-послідовною методикою:

1. Підбирання малюнка до предмету
2. Підбирання малюнка до його тіні  або контурного зображення
3. Підбирання підписів до малюнка (зображення)
