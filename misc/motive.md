When trying to help your child to actively participate in communication, there has to be:
* a need
* an opportunity
* and a reward for efforts.

Communicative Temptations are a way to make sure that these three things happen.
One of the most important things that we can do to assist in a child’s development of communication, is to not anticipate his or her needs/wants. By not anticipating, you give your child an opportunity to show what s/he needs/wants.
* Eat a desired food item in front of your child without offering any to him or her.
* Activate a windup toy,let it deactivate and hand it to your child.
* Give your child four blocks to drop in a box one at a time (or use some other action that your child will repeat, such a stacking the blocks or dropping the blocks on the floor), then immediately give your child a small animal figure to drop in the box.
* Look through a few books with your child.
* Initiate a familiar and an unfamiliar social game with your child until s/he expresses pleasure, then stop the game and wait.
* Open a jar of bubbles, blow bubbles,then close the jar tightly. Hand the closed jar to your child.
* Blow up a balloon and slowly deflate it. Hand the deflated balloon to your child or hold the deflated balloon to your mouth and wait.
* Hold a food item or toy that your child dislikes out near your child to offer it.
* Place a desired food item or toy in a clear container that your child cannot open while your child is watching. Put the container in front of your child and wait.
* Place your child’s hands in a cold; wet or sticky substance, such as jello, pudding or paste.
* Roll a ball to your child. After your child returns the ball three times, immediately roll a rattle or a toy on wheels to him or her.
* Engage your child in putting together a puzzle. After your child has put in 3 pieces, offer your child a piece that does not fit.
* Engage your child in an activity with a something that can be easily spilled (or dropped, broken, torn, etc.). Suddenly spill some of the substance on the table or floor in front of your child and wait.
* Wave and say “bye bye” to a toy upon removing it from the play area. Repeat this for a second and third toy, and do nothing when removing a fourth toy. These four trials should be interspersed throughout the other temptations, rather than be presented in a series.
* Hide a stuffed animal under the table. Knock, then bring out the animal. Have the animal greet your child the first time. Repeat this for a second and third time, and do nothing when bringing out the animal for the fourth time. These four trials should also be interspersed when presented.
* Put an object that makes noise in an opaque bag and shake the bag. Hold up the bag and wait.
* Give your child the materials for an activity of interest that needs an instrument for completion (e.g., piece of paper to draw on or cut; bowl of pudding or soup). Hold the instrument out of your child’s reach and wait.
* Engage your child in an activity of interest that needs an instrument for completion (e.g., crayon for drawing, spoon for eating, or wand for blowing bubbles). Have a third person come over and take the instrument, go sit on the distant side of the room, while holding the instrument within your child’s sight and wait.

We will pretend it is hard to open that jar, pretend we didn’t know that it is sooo hot, pretend we didn’t know the gorilla was in the room … at least until the learner lets us know.  But……We still need to go past our acting skills to make communication temptations work.   Here is a our quick 5 step process  for making communication temptations work:

1. Decide on the Goal–  Goals can be anything from specific communication functions (i.e., requesting, protesting, showing off, greeting, commenting, etc.),  semantic concepts (i.e., recurrence, action, attribute, locative, object etc…we need to always think about the goal), or even syntactical language concepts.  I will never forget from wayyyy back in graduate school (Thank you so much Dr. Amy Wetherby— & yes, I was so lucky).  I would be thinking  ‘how can I entice communication more ‘?  I knew I had great toys (thanks mom & dad for believing) but Dr. Wetherby would always write on my feedback– nice activity but…. “What’s the point”? or as I now know it to be ‘whats the specific goal’?.
2. Plan and Set up the Communication Temptation–  Again, way back to graduate school: Long distance relationships are not always great but for planning communication temptations, the commuting time (driving for hours between 2 colleges) really worked.  I would think and think of how to tempt communication.  One idea that I still use today is the use of a ‘ketchup’ cup instead of a regular cup for snack time.  People often ask me, what is a ketchup cup– it is the little cups you get from a fast food restaurant to put the ketchup in (I have also used medicine cups).  Over the years, we have been able to modify and now use espresso cups that are sold in our area. They look just like a regular paper cup just much smaller.  Communication temptations have always been super fun to me even if I have been called some names that some people would find derogatory (torturer comes to mind).  So what if I cut m & m’s in 4’s, my students could ask for as many as they wanted and I would give it to them, or so what if I stood in front of the TV while they were watching their favorite DVD, all they had to do was ask me to move.  We think of it like this, the more communication temptations we do each day, the more practice our students will get being the initiator of communication and as they get better and better at being the initiator instead of the responder they will be able to get what they want, socially interact, and self advocate much more than if we taught them to only respond when we asked them what they wanted, or we initiated every interaction with a “look at this”.
3.Model the Target Goal with Visual Supports/AAC system– Consider taking a turn with the communication temptation and model expectations. When you see a huge stuffed animal in the middle of a room, model the target language.  Don’t forget aided language input (ALI). Then the next time you present the temptation, do #4.
4. Implement a Wait & Signal Cue (use a time delay prompt)- Once you have the communication temptation in place, wait and expect communication.  If nothing happens, try to use a gestural cue (gesture in general towards the visual support or AAC device), if nothing happens still (& this may occur when first introduced) use a more specific visual cue (point to the appropriate words/symbols), and if more cueing is needed then try a physical prompt (one of the great things about using visual supports/AAC, is that you can physically prompt unlike a spoken speech only approach where you can not get into someone’s mouth and move it to make the correct words).
5. Reinforce Appropriately – Honor the temptation if it is a request (i.e., “more”- give the more- the toy, the food, etc.). Simultaneously, use a language expansion (i.e., more Lego’s). The general rule is if the learner  uses 0 words, model 1 word, if the learner uses 1 word model 2 words, if the learner uses 2 words, model 3 words, and if the learner uses 3 words model 4 words. Once a learner is using 4 words then you can model several more words (i.e., Learner- “want the big one”….Language Facilitator ” Come on, give me the really big one because I am starving”).  We use the reinforcement to give a more advanced form of language feedback with communication temptations.  We always use a positive vocal intonation with our language expansion but we avoid saying ‘good talking’ or ‘great use of a descriptor’ because at best that helps general positive feelings and at worst for many of my learners, they learn to say ‘good talking’ after everything they do….. (talk about making someone look different)

Cool communication temptations for REQUESTING– that we used with a young man, Wayne. When we first met Wayne, it seemed he did not want to take part in any activity and he had frequent self-injurious behavior. He did not use any spoken speech and was somewhat obsessed with round objects.  We found out quickly with an AAC device and visual supports that he had a great sense of humor, was creative, and loved learning (if he was interested). He also had an uncanny ability to recognize which people thought he had potential to learn language:
* Temptation– Balls in a plastic jar that had a screw type top learner could not open (any other jars, he could figure out how to open, but we could always close screw tops tighter then he could open & glass jars could easily be thrown into a wall and……).   Language  Target progressed from  ‘want ball’——- ‘want the ball with the rainbow inside’).
* Temptation-We would try to play with his favorite tennis ball but he had quick access to a no-tech symbol that indicated he wanted to ‘play alone’.  Language Target-  progressed from ‘alone’———-‘want to play alone please just for a while’.
* Temptation–After playing tennis, we would serve water in a very small cup (we live in Florida and it is very very ….very hot)  Language Target- ‘more—– please give me the big cup so I don’t wither away’.
* Temptation-Turn on the heat in the car (we still live in Florida, thanks Gwen (a mom) for this great idea). Language Target-progressed from ‘cool to please put on the air conditioner or else I may faint’
* Temptation-  sit in the chair next to his mom after a session and he learned this usually meant we would have a long conversation with mom  (he liked to leave once finished,  he came to see us us after a full day of school)   Language Target- progressed from ‘hurry’  to ‘please mom, I want to leave right now’.
* The underlying assumption to all of Wayne’s communication temptations is that the learner likes or is motivated by the temptation. Without the motivation, there is no enticement/temptation.

Wondering how to get your child talking? We speech-language therapists have lots of tricks in our pockets to do just that. One of our very favorites involves enticing children to talk by creating what we call communication temptations (Wetherby and Prizant, 1989).This little strategy can be used to help a late-talker start talking, to help a toddler begin using two-word phrases, or to increase the chances that a young child with autism will begin communicating.

Communication temptations are pretty much just what they sound like: we set up the environment to tempt children to communicate with us. The rationale for using them is also a pretty simple one: a child is much more likely to communicate if he has a reason for doing so!

Setting up communication temptations is easy and there are lots of ways to do so. Wetherby and Prizant (1989), who formalized the term, were pretty creative in their list of examples. They suggested things such as:
Offering your child something to eat you know he dislikes,
Putting a toy in an opaque bag and shaking it to get the child's interest,
Putting your child's hand in something sticky or gooey such as pudding, and
Waving bye-bye and saying "bye" as you put toys in a box three times, then pausing right before you put away the next toy.
Each of these ideas has one thing in common- the environment is set up so that a child is tempted to communicate about something ("no, I don't want that!" "what is that?" "yuck" or "bye!"). Another form of communication temptation involves enticing a child to request. This is a great place to start for any child, but it's especially good for kids with autism, because requesting is often the easiest form of communication for these children at first.

The steps to this type of communication temptation are as follows:
Find an activity or an object that your child really enjoys.  Look for an activity that is easily stopped and started (e.g., bubbles or a swing) or an object that has multiple parts that you can hand to your child (e.g., crackers that he loves to eat, cars for a car track).
Arrange the environment so that you create an obstacle to getting that object, but so that your child can see the object. For example, put your child's favorite crackers up on a high shelf. Or, put the cars in see-through container he can't open.
Start the activity, have a bit of fun and then stop (put the lid on the bubbles or pull him up in the swing but don't let him go) or give him one item (e.g., give him one cracker or one car).
Wait! Many parents forget this part, but it's an important one. Give your child a chance to communicate first.  Ideally, we want him to communicate without us helping him (we want him to initiate the communication), so always wait first. See what he does. Look expectantly at him, like you are waiting for him to do something (which, of course, you are!)
When he communicates with you (either verbally or nonverbally):
Give him what he wants and cheer him on--especially if it's the first time he's used that particular word or two-word phrase, or
Build on his communication just a bit to help him move into the next stage of speech and language development.
What you actually do for step number five depends completely on your child and his current level of communication.
If your child isn't yet using words, wait until he does something--anything-- to indicate that he wants more (e.g., moves his body in anticipation, points, reaches); when he does (and he will!), say the word for what he wants, wait just a few moments more, and give it to him
If your child vocalizes to indicate he wants more but doesn't actually say the word, say the word for him, wait just a few more seconds, and give him what he wants
If your child imitates the word, or even part of the word,  give him what he wants and cheer him on!
If your child always imitates your words, but doesn't say them on his own, try waiting progressively longer before you say the word for what he wants; wait for one second and then say the word, then (the next time), wait for two seconds before saying the word, then (the next time, wait for three seconds before saying the word....and so on. If he gets frustrated, go back to waiting a shorter amount of time and build up again.
If your child uses one word to request more of the item, use expansion to put his word into a two-word phrase for him (your child: swing! you: "more swing!"), wait for just a few more moments, and then give him what he requested
If your child uses one word, you might also want to use a choice that involves two different two-word phrases (your child: cracker!; you: "big cracker or little cracker?") and encourage him to use the two-word phrase to make a choice
If your child uses a longer phrase, but makes an error, you can correct his error by conversationally repeating what he said (your child: "wing!" you: "sssssswing!") and encourage him to imitate you accurately.
You might also think about using communication temptations to teach your child to use baby signs or pictures to communicate.
No matter what your child's level, communication temptations are often a very successful way to create opportunities for your child to advance her communication skills. Tempt away!

* Eat a food that the the child likes in front of them without offering any to him or her.
* Start a wind-up toy, let it run down, then hand it to the child.
* Hand the child several blocks, one by one, to drop in a can, then give the child a small toy to drop in.
* Start a familiar game, play it until the child expresses interest, then wait. Look at the child and give them a prompt (What do you want?).
* Open a bottle of bubbles, blow some with the wand, then close the bottle tightly and hand it to the child.
* Blow up a balloon and then let the air out. Hand the deflated balloon to the child.
* Put a food the child does not like near the child's mouth.
* Put a favorite toy or food in a clear container lid on it that the child cannot open. Hand the child the container and wait.
* Take the child's hand and put it in a cold, wet, or sticky substance such as pudding or water.
* Roll a ball to the child. After taking many turns rolling the ball back and forth, replace the ball with a car or other toy with wheels.
* Put a toy that makes noise in a clear plastic bag. Shake the bag and hold it up to the child.
* Bring the child a noew toy, or initiate a silly or unusual event (wear a bag on your head). Wait for the child to do something. When he or she does, build off of what they say ("I have something silly on my head!")
* Pay less attention than usual to the child; back away or turn your back during a game you are playing. Wait for the child to try to get your attention.
* Let the child explore the room for a few minutes. Wait for the child to direct your attention to an object he or she becomes interested in.
* Turn on some fast or fun music or a video with noise or talking on it, then turn it off. Wait for the child to signal for you to turn it on.

Ways To Get Your Child To Speak

ways of “tempting” your child to speak

Create an opportunity for the student to request materials, reinforcers, and/or help.

http://mommyspeechtherapy.com/?p=78

1. Eat something your child loves in their presence with out offering them any. When your child indicates that they would like some, model a more advanced way for them to make the request, whether it is using a sign, a word or a simple phrase. For example, if your child points and grunts to the candy, model the sign for candy then wait and see if your child will imitate the sign candy. If your child simply keeps pointing and grunting take his/her hand and help him make the sign for candy then reward him/her with the candy.

2. Play with something your child loves but don’t offer to share.
For instance if your child loves playing with playdough and wants to participate in the fun, you could model the /p/ sound for “please” or “play,” or you could model the signs for please or play. If your child can already say one word model a two word phrase for him/her to imitate like, “play please.”

3. At meal time and snack time give your child bite size portions, rather than dishing up a whole serving for them, then wait for them to request more. If no attempt is made model the sign “more,” help them make the sign, or model the /m/ sound for them to imitate.

4. Limit your child’s access to things like the t.v., toys, food, or going outside. Set it up so they have to make a request or ask for help to access these things. You may accomplish this by putting favorite things up high or locked up.

5. Play turn-taking games such as rolling the ball back and forth, or pushing a car back and forth. Once your child expects another turn hold the car or ball and wait. Look at him/her expectantly if no sign or verbal request is made, model an appropriate request such as the sign for “ball,” the /b/ sound, the word “ball” or “ball please”…

6. Use tight containers to store things in. When your child indicates he/she wants a cookie you might hand him/her the cookie jar (tightly sealed of course), when he/she can’t open it and hands it back to you make him/her sign open or help.

7. Use wind up toys or other toys that are difficult for kids to operate on their own. Wind up a wind-up toy your child gets a kick out of then hand it to them when they want a turn, wait for them to request help by using the sign or the word to operate the toy.

8. Blow bubbles then screw the lid on tightly and hand it back to your child for their turn. Wait for them to request help with a a sign or a word. Model the sign or word if necessary.

SETTING THE STAGE FOR COMMUNICATION
Communication should happen all day and everyday. Pictures need to be readily available right across the day,
not just at snack times or during a structured lesson.
The following ideas will help you set the stage for communication that can happen across the day:
Put things out of reach, on high shelves, in containers, so that students have a need to communicate.
Keep favourite items away for a few days, especially at the start of PECS, so that they are really
motivating.
Stop anticipating and meeting students‟ needs and responding to other attempts at communicating, such
as pulling you by the hand, crying, tantrums, etc.
Make your students want to communicate (see Communication Temptations on page 54 of your manual)



http://www.friendshipcircle.org/blog/2015/04/21/5-ways-to-encourage-communication-with-a-non-verbal-child-diagnosed-with-autism/

1. Enter into their world by using motivating people, items, etc. to encourage communication
For many children, food is motivating. For others, it could be specific toy, movie, friend, family member or neighbor.

For example, if your child loves interaction with a specific family member, use this motivating person to encourage communication. If you are using this person to encourage communication, use a variety of visual and auditory strategies (e.g. use a picture of the family member and/or model the name of this individual). Encourage your child to point to the picture of this person or exchange the picture with you to request it. When they are able to point or exchange the picture, the motivating person could come over to the child and give him or her a hug to fulfill the request.

To learn more information about using a picture exchange communication system, check out PECS USA.

2. Label feelings as they occur
For example, if your child is reaching for food in the fridge, label the feeling. For example, say “You are hungry”. The more your child hears the particular feeling with a specific behavior, the better they will be able to understand that feeling.

This strategy needs to be consistent and occur naturally. Modeling a feeling can happen when your child is excited, sad, hurt, happy, etc. For example, as your child expresses their excitement, say “I see you are excited”. If you have a picture of “excited” it can even reinforce the concept more. Learn more about using visuals here.

3. Assume competence
Assuming competence is probably one of the most important things we can do as a parent, caregiver, therapist, teacher, etc. Assuming competence for any child whether they have a disability or not is a form of empowerment.
Assuming that your child CAN do it and WILL do it is powerful. The other concept is speaking to a child with Autism like any other child. Children with or without disabilities pick up very quickly when an adult or another child is speaking to them in a different way. This can be a strategy that can very helpful when telling others how to speak to your child.

4. Model Language and use Aided Language Stimulation
Modeling language is an excellent strategy. Many times a child may not know the specific word or structure of a sentence. For example, if your child wants water at the dinner table and indicates that to you in a way that you will understand, say “I want water.” Giving the model will help improve your child’s receptive and expressive language.

Communicative Temptations
Communicative temptations create a reason for a child to communicate. They allow
opportunities for initiation. Good ways to provide communicative temptations are to
interrupt an established routine, “forget” to do something, or make desired items
inaccessible. Some suggested activities are listed below.
1. Give the child part of their food or drink and wait or eat a desired food in front of
them without offering any to them.
2. Interrupt an established routine and wait for their response.
3. Initiate a familiar game with the child until they express pleasure, then stop.
4. Open a jar of bubbles, blow bubbles, then close the jar tightly and hand it to the
child.
5. Blow up a balloon and slowly deflate it. Hold the deflated balloon up to your
mouth and wait or hand it to the child and wait.
6. Get the child interested in an activity that requires an instrument to complete,
ex. A crayon for colouring, a spoon for eating, a wand for blowing bubbles. Have
a third person come and take the item away and go to sit on the other side of
the room within the child’s sight. Wait.
7. Offer the child a food or toy that they dislike.
8. Activate a windup toy, let it run down, then hand it to the child.
